#  *ms* command line

SNP data before genotyping processes were generated by performing *ms*. Below is the command lines to generate SNP data under the two-split model.

```
ms nsam 10000 -t 20 -r 20 20000 -I 2 n1 n2 -ej t 2 1 > output_file.txt
```

where
  - nsam: Total number of samples
  - n1: number of samples in population-1
  - n2: number of samples in population-2
  - t: At time t, it gave rise to an instantaneously isolated subpopulaiton.
  - output_file.txt: name of the output file

In the above command, $n1$ and $n2$ haplotypes were sampled from population-1 and 2, respectively ($nsam = n1+n2$). $\Theta=4Nu=20$, $\rho = 4Nrl=20$, and $l=20000$ were assumed.

Please see the manuscript for a detailed explanation and the actual values used in this project.
